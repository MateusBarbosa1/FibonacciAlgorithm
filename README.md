# Fibonacci Sequence

A sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

The formula to calculate the Fibonacci sequence is:

Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

Where:
- `Fn` is the current number in the sequence.
- `Fn-1` is the number before `Fn`.
- `Fn-2` is the number before `Fn-1`.
